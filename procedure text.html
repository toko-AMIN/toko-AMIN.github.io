        How to Make Homemade Cream Cheese
      </h2><br>
      <p id="normal">
        Cream cheese is a flexible <mark>ingredient that can be used</mark> to make many different types of edibles. <mark>Cream cheese that is pasteurized and homogenized</mark> with lactic acid bacteria also brings healthy nutritional contents, such as Vitamin C, Iron, Calcium, and so forth. But, lactic acid bacteria can be hard to find. Therefore, we can use citric acid in lemon juice as an alternative. Procedure on how to make a cream cheese involves some very simple steps. But, you need a lot of patience and utmost care in making cream cheese this way. However, the results will be satisfying. <mark>The ingredients that are used</mark> to make cream cheese are 1 liter of milk and 6 spoons of lemon juice. If it’s possible, use a full cream milk so it can produce much more cream cheese. It’s also better to extract lemon juice from the fruit itself so it’s more fresh. Meanwhile, <mark>the tools that are used</mark> are pot, wooden spatula, cheese cloth, strainer, bowl, and food processor. Cheese cloth is partially hard to find in supermarkets, <mark>so it can be bought</mark> in online shops. </p><br><br>

        <p id="normal">All of the <mark>ingredients and tools that have been mentioned</mark> are things that are quite essential and cannot be replaced with alternative substitutes. Therefore, make sure you own all of these things. Now, let’s hop on to the steps on how to process and make a cream cheese. First off, pour the full cream milk into the pot. Secondly, turn on the stove and make it a medium heat. Then, wait until the milk is boiling subtly. Later on, slowly add a spoonful of lemon juice 6 times. One thing to note is to not pour it all right away. We have to make sure that <mark>the lemon juice being added</mark> isn't going to make clumps of cream cheese that are too solid because it will be hard to soften it. Stir gently with a wooden spatula after each addition. After that, put the strainer above the bowl, then the cheese cloth above the strainer. Following that, slowly pour the milk and lemon mixture on the cheese cloth to collect the clumps resulting from mixing milk and lemon juice. <mark>Filtering step is done slowly and alternately.</mark> Squeeze the cheese cloth to remove the excessive liquid. But, don’t throw it away because you can use the liquid if the clumps are too solid to be processed. After that, leave it set for 15 minutes. Finally, put the clumps in the food processor and process it until it becomes softer. The result is what you have, a homemade cream cheese. </p><br><br>

          <p id="normal">Those were some easy moves, right? This recipe will result in a cream cheese that has a strong hint of sourness from the lemon juice. As what we have mentioned, the cream cheese can be used to cook or bake many dishes, such as cheese cake, stuffed mushroom, cream cheese stuffed chicken, or even as a food dressing or a food dip that compliments. Let’s try and make it together!

        How to Make <i>Sotonk</i>
      </h2><br>
      <p id="normal">
        Our product, <i>Sotonk</i> has a basic fishery ingredient, namely squid or preferably cuttlefish, where we process the cuttlefish by dipping it in diluted flour then frying it. It is a light snack to eat but still a delicious snack to devour. You can serve it in many flavors, but before that, let’s take a look at how to make it. <mark>The ingredients that are used</mark> to make <i>Sotonk</i> are medium-sized cuttlefish, 450 grams flour, 225 grams cornstarch, cold water, pepper, chicken stock seasoning, crushed thyme, ginger powder, flavoring powder, and 1 liter cooking oil. Meanwhile, <mark>the tools that are needed</mark> are, among other things; a cutting board, a knife, a bowl, a measuring spoon, a spatula, a wok, a strainer, and a basin.</p><br><br>

        <p id="normal">First off, prepare and wash <mark>all tools and ingredients that will be used</mark>. Next, clean then cut the side of the squid according to the shape you want. After that, sprinkle the salt on the cuttlefish and spread it with your hands, then wash it once again with water. <mark>This step is done</mark> so that the squid is not too fishy and <mark>the mucus is removed</mark>. Then, thread the squid using a skewer. To use a skewer is not a must, so feel free to suit your preferences on how you serve the Sotonk. Thereafter, season the cleaned squid with salt and pepper for a hint of taste. But, make sure to not season the cuttlefish with too much pepper because <mark>the cuttlefish can be blackened by its excessive amount</mark> and could ruin the food presentation.  Now, let’s make the dry flour mixture. To make the dry flour mixture, mix flour, cornstarch, 2 tablespoons of salt, 1 tablespoon of pepper, 1 tablespoon of chicken stock seasoning, and a little bit of baking powder. Stir it good so the flavors are well mixed. Later on, take about 1⁄3 of the dry flour mixture and transfer it to a separate bowl to make the wet flour mixture. Add about 6 tablespoons of cold water to the flour for the wet flour mixture, then stir until evenly mixed but not too liquidy. Add a little crushed thyme and ginger powder to the wet flour mixture for a hint of spice. Following that, pour the oil into the wok on the stove, turn on the heat, and wait until the oil gets hot. After it gets hot, fry the cuttlefish. But before, dip the squid into the wet flour mixture first, then into the dry flour mixture. Fry the squid until golden yellow. Finally, take and drain the fried squid so it's not too oily. Flour fried squid is ready to be enjoyed!</p><br><br>

          <p id="normal">Again, those were some easy steps! As we were saying, <mark><i>Sotonk</i> can be served</mark> with a variety of flavoring powder, like <i>balado</i> powder, barbeque, roasted corn, and many others as you like. Let’s try and make it together!</p><br><br>
